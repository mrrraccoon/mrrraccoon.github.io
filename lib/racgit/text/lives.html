            <p> pair of greasy fingers flung back the latch. The hinges squeaked as they bashed against the side of the sun-baked
            bricks. A warm energy radiating out of them; it felt nice to the touch. It crept into the palm of her hands as they
            pressed against the mortar and concrete. Echoes of laughter lingered as she quickly remembered to shut the door. She
            flicked back the latch with such quickness that her heart leapt high before settling once again. She placed her back
            against the door, sliding down it's length. The wood too radiated warmth. It eased her tense back, flexed rigid against
            the ever present rules of hide-and-seek.
            She pushed herself up and shuffled to the edge of the barrier that surrounded the balcony garden. She traced a straight
            vertical line upward, taking in all the major details of the city above and below. She smiled at the birds. She smiled
            as the shadows flowed over the buildings and into the details. The current versions made it all quite majestic. She
            smiled because deep down she knew that she was a part of this magnificent creation, this simulation. Only for moments
            later she would be found. It’s a nice bittersweet pause before being returned by a neuro-snap.

            Since Ghosts skyrocketed in price people were beginning to crave cheaper fair. Majvaj, and the newest generational
            knock-off Ghost out of Japan, Sō-me, hit the depressed markets and flourished like well adapting fauna. It wasn't the
            same quality memories as before, but it did the trick. No one bought Sō-me unless they were desperate. They needed the
            high they get from the memories, only Sō-me is a knock-off of a knock-off and everyone knows it, but when times are
            tough, you take what you can get and call it even.
            But there was something off about it all with this last dose.
            The little details were fuzzy, important, but fuzzy. She knew that much. She felt it in the tightness of her gut. Felt
            the lack of details on the simplest items jarring. She felt the taste of hair in her mouth and subconsciously brushed
            back nothing. It was all part of the residue left over. The cheaper stuff really was sub-par. Ejecting the centimeter
            thick disc she flipped it around in her fingers. In the center engraved in a thin strip of metal was carved, “Sō-me”.
            She clasped the poker chip sized disc in her hand tightly.
            “Motherfucker.” She said, stepping out of the unit, “I should have known better than to trust scum selling from out of
            their boot.” She shook her head and blinked quickly
            She breathed in deep and ran her hand over her face. No point in sitting around.
            The diner was busy. People always needed to eat. The neon lights that buzzed on and off from depleted elements mixed
            with a greasy pellet farm. You want a greasy double-cheeseburger? You got it, only it’s in capsule form and cost just
            slightly less than the real thing.
            She slid into a red vinyl seat with gold and silver glitter in the white parts of the vinyl. It’s straight out of the
            fifties and makes no excuses.
            Having ordered she laced her fingers in front of her on the table and disengaged for a moment. The voice became more
            than an insect buzz. She could still feel the memories from earlier. The disc may have said it was something is was not,
            but those memories were more than Ghost quality. The feeling of a ghost inside her made her shiver suddenly and try to
            forget about it for the moment.
            In the fuzzy background the short-order cook shouted and a mobia with a pastel patchwork quickly sat her order down in
            front of her before zipping to another end of the restaurant and then just as quickly to another. Looking deeper into
            the greasy-spoon the clear lines of the mobian faces darted glances at her and just as quickly looked away. They didn’t
            care who she was or why she came to be there. Mobia weren’t designed to judge. Judgment came from humanity. Division
            wrought of mortal hands. She pushed her food around before settling the bill and leaving.
            The walkways hummed with foot traffic and the gentle taps of mobian feet. Multitudes upon multitudes of storefronts and
            commerce sprawled out in front of her. Keeping her head down and covered by a small hoodie she walked at first in the
            direction of her dealer, however midway shifted direction and now walked towards her own domicile.
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">3</h2>
            The tiny paws batted at the minuscule piece of yarn that hung off the chair. The twelve-and-a-quarter centimeter tall
            feline cocked it’s head as the thread woffed in the air. It quickly disengaged from it and walked towards the door. A
            familiar tap on the simulation wood stairs took it’s attention.
            The door whooshed to the side and presented to Our Good King Rathmar their owner to which they meowed and ran their back
            across her shines. This naturally translated into, “Gone in hunt of another fix, I see.”
            “Chatty kitty I see.” She said, stepping around Our Good King Rathmar and tossing the disc on the closest table before
            falling onto the couch and attempting to melt into its fabric. She sat there motionless watching the digits of the clock
            change… 53… 54… 55… It was in this brief interlude between the fifty-fourth and fifty-fifth minute that she realized she
            should probably feed Our Good King Rathmar.
            The can opener whirled at a soul crushing pace while the cat walked back and forth on the bar. Meowing at irregular
            intervals the cat waited patiently as it could muster for Cemal to pull back the pull tab for dinner, instead Cemal
            focused on her own nurishment. The usual routine followed soon after of any typical citizen of the Anaximander. After
            all was put away and Our Good King Rathmar lay close to a heating vent purring, Cemal stepped into her isolation pod and
            closed her eyes.
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">4</h2>
            The sun began baking the imitation terra cotta walls with their sheet metal roofs with each advancing ray. Cemal’s
            favorite place to visit early in the morning is a wonderful Brazilian bakery with the warmest walls of oranges and deep
            teak. A puff pastry and honey is set before her on the small metal table and she can feel the humidity settling on her
            skin. There’s tightness in her cheeks from the slowly growing smile that crosses her lips.
            She breathes deep taking in the notes of the wonderful smelling food and sounds. She couldn’t remember the last time she
            travelled to Brazil. She missed the people and the feeling of the dirt on her toes in the jungles, and the bright colors
            and sounds and smells of happiness coming down through the streets found within the city. Picking up the small cup of
            coffee she sipped it and looked as far as she could down the street.
            Two children were playing futbol; one child clearly the victor against the other in most athletic ways. Finishing her
            morning coffee, she set off deeper into the city. She passes by the two children, the loser is upset because of the
            superior skills the other possess. The other just shrugs it off, “Jogue o jogo.” He said, as she walks farther down the
            street. The streets are a mixture of cobblestones and concrete with dashes of asphalt...
