            <p>He squirmed on the couch, the cushions felt like the odd armored
                plates of an ugly brown bug he saw once as a toddler. The shades
                were drawn partially enough to allow light in to create-- Not a
                cold or warm place, more morose than anything, or was the word he
                was looking for “solemn”? He wasn’t certain and would most
                certainly forget by the time he left the psychologist’s office.
                As he turned his head and squinted at the carpet, he heard the
                murmur, it first sounded like a hollow tone deep in the chest, a
                rumbling as metal vibrated like a church bell. It modulated to a
                higher pitch and then back again.
            <p>He envisioned the screen of an oscilloscope. Watching the little
                green line zoom up and down, and up and down, and the background
                a deep, ugly green color. The murmur would come again and fade and
                come again and fade. The floor would come in and out of focus, and
                he let his mind run, and run, and run, until he no longer felt
                like bring it all back to reality again. It pained him to exist in
                a reality in which nothing was fair, and nothing was assured, to
                bring this aching to be alive and so very much be dead. He had to
                see it all through, his curiosity drew him, a moth and a flame
                destined to dance a dance of eternity until their wave functions
                collapsed and they either became more than they were, or just like
                a magic trick--- Poof, no more.
            <p>He wiggled a little backwards until his back rested against the
                couch’s arm. He never knew what to say when he sat in the chair.
                It wasn’t an executioner’s desk or anything of the like. Sometimes
                he said nothing at all for the entire time. Just sat in the chair
                and looked at the clock. Watching the arms race around the face
                and he wondered to himself on a few occasions why the parts of a
                clock had the names they did, even though, rationally it couldn’t
                be more planner than day.
            <p>The murmur continued, and he brought his gaze towards the ceiling.
                Popcorn they called it. It only scarcely looked like popcorn and
                probably tasted a thousand times worse.
            <p>“Oram?”
            <p>The name sounded familiar. Or was he just mentally over
                exaggerating the extent to which he couldn’t understand the maroon
                vested head eater.
                <hr>
            <p>“Oram?”
            <p>Continuing to look at the ceiling, he began to think about the
                upcoming autumn season. How all the yellows would turn to orange
                and red and brown and tan. How the bright colors of spring would
                melt into these dull rough feeling colors.
            <p>He would remember his feet being cold, no matter how many pairs of
                socks he slipped on. He would remember the smell of the firewood
                once his father split it and stacked it against the outside of the
                house to cure.
            <p>He remembered the way the light played off the curve of the
                Thanksgiving turkeys large breast. He remembered the warmth of his
                father’s rough beard and how it scratched his cheeks. He also
                remembered the spiced cider as it slid down his throat, and warmed
                his belly, and made him content on those cold nights when the
                leaves turn extra crispy beneath his boots, and how he would hold
                his middle school girl friends hand and how her cold knuckles
                reminded him that even though he remained young now, it would fade
                away. It would cease to be, and that hand would fade away and he
                would only be left holding air. A cold silent air that relentlessly
                bit at his cheeks, making them red and hot as soon as he came in
                from the cold.
            <p>He could remember the soft melodies of the back-road country music
                her parents played on the radio and he wanted to weep because he
                would never experience these wonderful moments again. They were
                there, and he exist now. Not then, and he would certainly never go
                back there. Time, much like a woman is a fickle thing. He could
                reach his hand out and struggle and thrash, but he would never
                gain those feelings again. He would never feel his index finger
                running over the cold dry ashy knuckle of her hand.
            <p>He blinked his eyes, and pressed his palm into one and removed the
                tear held by surface tension to his cornea.
            <p>“Oram.” The murmur no longer questioned his name, but for certain
                knew it to be true. It repeated it over and over until quite
                suddenly, like a cold, dry, dead tree twig, his attention snapped
                back at him.
            <p>He looked over at the maroon-vested shrink, his eyes only slightly
                larger than usual.
                <hr>
            <p>“What?” he said. He tried to muster something more, but it slipped
                off his tongue and fell to the floor only to dissolve through the
                cracks in the hard wood flooring as it heaved and shuttered.
            <p>“It’s time.”
            <p>From the couch to the gurney, to the operating table seemed to
                blur and smash together like an Italian neo-realist film. Snaps and
                scraps of images flooded in front of his eyes and blips of sounds
                that he remembered on the playground, and how the sand even when
                cold felt so wrong to him. It felt as though it wasn’t sure what
                it wanted to be. Would it hug what little rain it could find in an
                embrace so strong, so tight, it would certain never let go and
                stay mud and clay, or, would the sand continue to just blow on the
                winds never resting and never stopping, whipping around corners
                and across continents. Such is the nature of frantic sand he
                thought. He smiled.
            <p>How silly can we all be, how far will we allow ourselves to reach
                until we stop and take a moment to step back and look at the
                amusing little monkeys we’ve become. How devilish we’ve become,
                how wonderful we’ve become, how graceful, and how unbalanced, and
                how ironic we’ve all become.
            <p>As many cold hands held his forehead he could certainly tell the
                difference in temperature. The restraining strap felt far better.
                He smiled and blinked slowly at the bright, mercury light suspended
                over his head. He thought about how the light swung back and forth,
                if it were alive, how would it feel, how would it react to us
                walking through the check lists and fleeting moments of our lives
                and never stopping to wonder at the majesty of the moon, or
                beguiling nature of the brain.
            <p>Oram never imagined his life would play this little quick one scene
                play. He imagined as everyone else he knew might, he would marry
                a charming woman. They would travel the world and smell flowers in
                drizzly rain forest, and smile with their perfect smiles and they
                would laugh endlessly, and their laughs would remain for eternity,
                until they had a son, and then followed it with a girl, and they
                would marvel at how they grow up so fast. He would send them off
                to school, and watch as the marks on the door frame grew higher
                and higher until they stopped, and the penciled-on dates and
                heights would fade and smudge.
                <hr>
            <p>He wished he had done so many things differently. But deep down,
                inside the knot of his chest he knew that had he done anything
                different, thought any different thought, everything would have
                changed with a flutter of a wing.
            <p>The metal seemed wet to him as it crawled up his nose. And then,
                just like that Oram became just another piece of magic--- Poof, no
                more. And if not for a moment, not even given a second of time, he
                smiled a tiny smile only for himself. No one would make it out
                alive, but he would. He would.
