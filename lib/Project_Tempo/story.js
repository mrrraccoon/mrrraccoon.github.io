/* The Snow Storm
Weather plays an important part in our NOUN everyday.
What is weather you ask?
According to ADJ scientists, who are known as meterologists,
weather is what the NOUN is like at any time of the NOUN.
It doesn't matter if the air is ADJ or ADJ, its all weather.
When vapors in ADJ clouds condense, we have NOUN and snow.
A lot of NOUN means a ADJ snowstorm!
