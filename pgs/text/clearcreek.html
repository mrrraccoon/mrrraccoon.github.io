        <div class="title">A Burning At Clear Creek</div>
        <div class="copy">
            At ten on a Sunday morning the community filled the pews of the Clear Creek Baptist Church. The smell of spring floated
            in the air as flowers pushed themselves from the dirt.
            Inside the Fellowship the air was cool with a cross breeze creeping through. The preacher stood high upon the pulpit.
            Fans waifed rosy cheeked hymeneal women in the congregation.
            “If we confess our sins,” He said, emphasizing each word with his index finger.
            “He is faithful and just. And. He will forgive us our sins, purify us from all unrighteousness. John, one nine.”
            A coarse stubble covered his cheeks from a distant shave. In his raised hand, a red bible. His free hand gesticulated
            with fervor. At moments pounding upon the rostrum. His knuckles pale as he slammed his hand against the wood.
            “He will cleanse you of your transgressions; Heaven, the great gift for us all!”
            The Spirit flowed through him. His brow was sweaty and he constantly had a handkerchief swabbing it. He collapsed into
            the chair behind the podium.
            Everyone filed out onto the lawn as the preacher shook each person’s hand. The grass cut short to hide the yellowing
            dead spots. The wind had become angry, whipping the large hats the women wore about. A snarling storm sat on the
            horizon.
            The crowd thinned like fog on a warm morning. The preacher and his daughters and sons closed the doors on the church and
            locked it; they walked to their home next to the church on the other side of the little creek.
            At noon the church lay in a heap of burning timber and ash with the smell of smoke blanketing the flowers. The smoke
            could be seen over the hills. My father and I saw it as we sat on the portico while mother sat at the table for lunch.
            We raced to the Stude’ and sped to the house of prayers. Upon our arrival I saw the cross fall. The grayed desiccated
            boards popped and splintered as it lay in the inferno.
            Brother Digby held Kate in his arms; her cheeks were stained with ash. Father parked the Starliner about fifty feet away
            from the bonfire that burned the bones of our community.
            The fire engine flew like a mad cardinal down the black-top road towards community. No matter how hard the driver
            smashed his black boot into the floor, the engine would go no faster, and it needed not. The church crumbled like a
            house of cards.
            I walked closer until the heat drove me back again. I could hear the engine coming in the distance and turned my head
            towards the sound the same as those who had turned up. Digby’s shoulder had become a mono-toned watercolor.
            The engine pulled up close to the fire; a water truck pulled in behind it and unleashed the torrent. Just as the blessed
            water washes away our sins, the water washed away the flames. Black pools of mixed water and ash collected as the flames
            were extinguished. The preacher and his family stood back aways from the building. I sat against the chrome bumper of
            the car, the guts of bugs smeared across it.
            My father collected me, firmly placing a hand on my back. I slid into the front seat of the car and drove away. That
            night we had a simple meal to remind us of how little we needed to get by in life and that any sort of decadence was,
            and should always be considered a blessing, not something to take for granted. Mother explained. The meal was quiet. I
            enjoyed a quiet meal. I suspect that father did too.
            I helped Mother clean up the kitchen and then we listened to The Great Gildersleeve. Bronco is a silly character. The
            fire made me yawn. I slept soundly deep into the night.
            The next morning my father and I drove back to the site of the church. On the horizon gray clouds crept on silent toes.
            A curtain of rain fell to the soil, knocking on the ground with a thousand hammers, furious to awaken the seeds buried
            below. I felt a rumbling in the pit of my stomach as I rode with my father in the Stude’.
            “A mean storm is coming, Ansell.” My father said. I reached over and grabbed the large umbrella leaning against the
            seat. I looked up at his face just as he looked down. The awakened light cut deep valleys into his face. He smiled at me
            as he placed his strong hand on my shoulder. We passed over the cow guard and through the boundary of the old barbed
            wire fence. Smoke rose lazily to the yonder above. I could hear the rocks crunching under the tires as the ton and a
            half car crawled up the path.
            We parked the car and walked towards the corpse. The church’s foundations of cement and red brick lay bare atop the
            hill. We explored the ash for a few moments then walked down to the car. Turning again towards the ruin of the church we
            rested our bottoms against the grill. A pleasant warmth radiated from it.
            I watched Brother Orel walk up the spine of the hill with a sturdy shovel in his hands. His shirt sleeves were rolled up
            above his elbows. His collar was unbuttoned and flapped in the wind from the advancing storm. His face was covered in
            sweat and grime.
            As he reached the top my father handed me a quarter of an apple to eat. Orel dug the shovel into the ash, the sounds it
            made is what I imagine sticking a knife into a pig sounded like. He heaved it up and tossed it into a nearby
            wheelbarrow. I ate another slice of apple as we watched Orel fill up the wheelbarrow and cart it off. The storm was much
            closer now. I could see in the distance the curtain of rain engulfing hills to the West of us. I wasn’t for certain, but
            the storm looked to be getting faster.
            I bit into the quarter. It was juicy and a little ran down my chin. I wiped it away with my sleeve. I climbed up on the
            metal hood of the car and draped my legs over the side and let them rest on the wheel fenders. A gust tossed my hair
            into my eyes. Towards the back of the church Sister Kate shifted through the cool, water drowned ash. Bits of crumbled
            black wood stuck to her hands and found its way beneath her fingernails. Kate moved boards to one side. Her hands were
            becoming blackened by the charcoal created by the burnt wood. She tossed a couple pieces aside and then grabbed one and
            began digging in the muck.
            As she scarred the earth from the corner of her eye she saw a glint of gold. Crouched on her toes, she plunged her
            fingers into the filth. Scooping deep into the muck she pulled out a simple golden cross. The majority of the metal was
            tarnished from the smoke, but beneath its grayed surface the yellow metal remained bright. She smiled a toothy smile.
            The corners of her eyes creased and she took in the small shape fully with her eyes.
            A younger sister of thirteen stood up about twenty feet from her, stretching her back. She looked over at Kate,
            carefully stepping, she made her way towards her.
            “Whatcha got there?” Jennifer asked.
            “Just a cross.”
            “That looks to be mine.”
            “Couldn’t be, Brother Orel gave me a cross just the same.”
            Orel looked up at the sound of his name. He rammed the shovel into the ground and wiped the sweat from his forehead.
            “As the Lord is my witness, that there is mine.” The younger sister said.
            Kate’s hands reached her neckline. Charcoal residue tarnished the Kerrybrooke white blouse. Her hands moved around the
            fabric frantically. She cast her eyes to the ground as she searched among the folds of the cloth. She froze. Her eyes
            rose towards Sister Jennifer.
            “I——” She said. “Jenny.” Her face took on a menace, an anger, a seriousness that quivered beneath her flesh. “Orel.” She
            said, turning her attention to him. He had closed the distance between his shovel and the girls.
            “Orel.” Jennifer said. Small pools trembled on her lower lids.
            The man retreated half way back to his shovel.
            “I don’t know what she’s,” he said pointing at Jenny, “talking about.”
            “Are you implying that Jenny is fast?!” Kate called.
            I noticed my father’s hand come into my vision. He handed me another quarter of the apple and as I took it I saw
            Brothers Digby and Daniel coming across from the small stream that ran into the over growth.
            “What are you hens quarreling over?” Digby asked.
            Kate quickly crossed the quagmire of ash. Her shoe heels plugging holes in it as she stepped firmly.
            “This here cross,” she thrust out her hand, ash residue still speckled it. The cross sat in her palm, “Jenny says it’s
            hers, and I say it’s mine.”
            “And who’s was it?”
            “Well…”
            “Well… Well what? Who’d it belong to?” He said.
            “It’s mine. Orel gave it to me.” Jennifer confessed.
            My father placed a hand on the back of my neck and we walked partly towards the top of the hill where the ruckus was
            taking place.
            “Is this true?!” Digby asked.
            “I—— He gave me one too.” Kate said, she reached into her blouse and drew out a small thin golden chain. Daniel was
            pacing back and forth in a tight oval behind Digby. Dangling from the chain hung an identical cross.
            I could see that Daniel wasn’t particularly fond of the events atop the hill considering his bull shark attitude.
            “You Jezebel!” Sister Jenny yelled. Her indignation escaped its bounds. She lurched towards Kate. As the distance
            between the two closed quickly, Daniel stepped between the two of them. Angry volleys of fist and open hands flew. The
            brunt of which landed among Daniel’s face and neck. Brother Digby pulled Jenny away a few steps down the hill. Orel
            grabbed Kate around the waist and carried her kicking a few paces from Jennifer. Digby plopped Jenny down on her bottom
            in the ash. Her face got real sour looking and she struggled back to her feet. Kate continued to try and free herself
            from Orel’s tight grasp around her waist.
            His cheeks were rosy from fingernails. Trails across the side of his neck and cheeks began the welt up. The storm was no
            longer in the distance. It moved up towards their hill with an abrupt pace. The flight of fists halted, Daniel sunk to
            his knees into the soft mud and ash. As his knees touched the earth, a boom of thunder rippled across the sky.
            I felt it for certain in my gut. My knees grew momentarily weak and they bent under the sounds from on high.
            “God telling them to stop father?” I asked.
            “No. He’s already taken their church. He’s letting them fight it out.”
            My father and I walked back down to the car and got inside.
            The matriarchal Mother Marsh came with the wind. As my father and I sat in the car the words were hard to hear, but I
            firmly believe that day the church wasn’t the only thing to burn to pieces. Most of the words were drowned out by the
            thunder and wind. And as Mother Marsh turned her back on her progeny she walked back to the house.
            The rain began to come down harder. We started the car and rode away. There was nothing to see there anymore. All the
            lives on top of that hill had fallen apart. Years later it was said that Pastor Marsh was beat to death by Brother Digby
            for committing transgressions that he just couldn’t look beyond. The girls turned out okay from what I could tell. They
            of course moved out of Clear Creek to the larger town just down the road. The church was never rebuilt. No one came,
            they had taken up with different flocks.
            Standing on the hill looking out over the valleys scarred by the streams, the blood bonds that once held the community
            together were now washed away with the rains.
