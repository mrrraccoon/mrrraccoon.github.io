    - Introduction:
    While I no longer seek to capture the world through a lens as often and with as much vigor as I did once, I want to share with people what I feel are achievements photographically. It should be noted, no award-winning  photography has been included here as with design awards, it is far too  numerous and of its own merits. 
    
    - Photos: 
    Abandonment, Revised 
    The interior of the building, when filled with the busy lives of those  around us, it has the distinction of being a coveted barbecue joint. It stood vacant in a once thriving main street of a small Texas town. 
     
    - Caterpillars 
    I enjoyed the presentation of macro-photographic technique with this image  and the small bugs themselves. 
     
    - Flower in Water 
    When you first get into photography it  's about volume over quality. That will come in time. I know I had to take this image a dozen times. Something just wasn't right with it, until I got this one.  
     
    - Gallery Books, Mount Vernon 
    I '92m particularly proud of this image. Aside from coating the film and the    photographic paper, I made this image from scratch. I hand wound the film  into the canister, set all the lighting, took this single image, took the    film back, developed it by hand in a dark room, printed the negative by hand   and edited the print by hand. This is a digital scan of the original hand     printed negative. 
     
    - Gone 
    They say even with the worst tools and artist will prevail. This is another     image that I edited before taking it. Old headstone found in a creek bed in     Mount Pleasant, Texas 
     
    - James Henderson 
    I don '92t normally do portraiture. The natural landscape has too much of a     draw. I worked with James for a while in the pipe mills of low-class    America.  
     
    - Long Exposure Branch In Water 
    Having access to some pretty dense ND filters I also like to stretch long   exposures as far as possible within limits. Shot in a small park with     stacked ND filters. 
     
    - Long Exposure No 1. 
    First attempt at a digital long exposure with fill manual controls at my    disposal. I enjoy the clouds. 
     
    - Matthews Sunrise 
    Local cemetery in Northeast Texas, manual HDR experiment. 
     
    - Metal Box, Pond 
    I never knew what this box had in it, or what it did, or was for. It    remained a mystery even to this day. I enjoy black and white photography. I    think it appeals to my logical view of the world. 
     
    - Mono Chrysanthemum 
    Found in a tiny little pot on our old home  's front porch, a bunch of     chrysanthemums. I worked so long to get the highlights just right as I knew     I would take this into a black and white image. I was right, it was worth   the time.
